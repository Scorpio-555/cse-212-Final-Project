# Welcome To Python Data Structure Tutorials

## Introduction

Here we will dive into three types of data structures: Stack, Set and BST (binary search tree). Each tutorial: 

* Gives a description of what the data structure is, providing metaphors and examples

* Contains a section or two that addresses key vocabulary for that data structure in further detail

* Provides an Illustration of the data structure & its Operation Table

* Ends with an Example Problem as well as a Problem to Solve

There is a link provided to view the solution to the Problem to Solve. Please only refer to it after you have completed the problem.
